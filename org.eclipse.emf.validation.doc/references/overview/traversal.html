<h1><a name="top">Traversal Strategies</a></h1>

<p>
The batch validator, by default, recursively validates the content tree of the
<em class="CodeName">EObject</em>s that are presented to it for validation.  However,
a model may not necessarily be hierarchically structured, but may have a flat or highly
cross-referenced structure.  At its logical extreme, it may be normal for instances of a
model to be distributed across a considerable number of resources, even with just one
element in each resource.  To support models like this, clients can define
<em class="UILabel">traversal strategies</em> to help the validator to discover the
graph of related elements to validate.

<p>
An <a href="../javadoc/org/eclipse/emf/validation/service/ITraversalStrategy.html"><em class="CodeName">ITraversalStrategy</em></a>
is basically an iterator, providing some additional context information and controls.
In fact, clients are encouraged to extend the
<a href="../javadoc/org/eclipse/emf/validation/service/AbstractTraversalStrategy.html"><em class="CodeName">AbstractTraversalStrategy</em></a>
class because it requires simply an estimate of the amount of work (for the progress monitor)
and an iterator that supplies the elements to validate, in sequence.
</p><p>
When the validation operation begins, the framework first calls the
<em class="CodeName">startTraversal(Collection, IProgressMonitor)</em> method, providing the
elements serving as roots of the traversal (e.g., the user's selection in the UI) and the
progress monitor.  Then, the <em class="CodeName">hasNext()</em> and
<em class="CodeName">next()</em> are used in the usual way as for iterators to obtain
elements to validate.  After each element is validated, the framework calls the
<em class="CodeName">elementValidated()</em> method, indicating the result of the element
validation in case that might influence the subsequent traversal.
</p><p>
The final consideration concerns <a href="bindings.html">client contexts</a>.  With each
element that it provides, the traversal strategy is asked whether it is in a different
client context than the one before.  This is the trigger for the framework to recompute
the client context, which can be a computationally expensive operation.  In general, it
makes sense to recompute the client context when the traversal follows a cross-reference
(non-containment) but not when it follows a containment reference.
</p>

<h2>Using Traversal Strategies</h2>

<p>
An <a href="../javadoc/org/eclipse/emf/validation/service/IBatchValidator.html"><em class="CodeName">IBatchValidator</em></a>
can be configured with a traversal strategy.  The framework provides two default implementations
as inner classes of the <em class="CodeName">ITraversalStrategy</em> class:  the
<em class="CodeName">Flat</em> and <em class="CodeName">Recursive</em> strategies.  The
latter traverses the content trees of the traversal roots, while the latter only returns
those roots without descending into their contents.
</p><p>
The default traversal strategy, where the client does not specify one explicitly, is a
composite strategy that delegates to implementations registered on the
<a href="../extension-points/org_eclipse_emf_validation_traversal.html"><em class="CodeName">org.eclipse.emf.validation.traversal</em></a>
extension point.  Where it cannot find a delegate on the extension point, it uses the
<em class="CodeName">ITraversalStrategy.Recursive</em> as a default.
</p>
<pre>
   &lt;extension
         point="<b>org.eclipse.emf.validation.traversal</b>"&gt;
         
      &lt;<b>traversalStrategy</b>
            namespaceUri="http:///org/eclipse/emf/examples/library/extlibrary.ecore/1.0.0"
            class="org.eclipse.example.validation.traversal.EXTLibraryTraversalStrategy"/&gt;
         &lt;<b>eclass</b> name="Person" /&gt;
         &lt;<b>eclass</b> name="Item" /&gt;
      &lt;/traversalStrategy&gt;
   &lt;/extension&gt;
</pre>
<p>
This example shows an extension that declares a traversal strategy for the EXTLibrary
meta-model.  It applies to traversals starting at <em class="CodeName">Person</em>s or
<em class="CodeName">Item</em>s (rather than at libraries), perhaps because its purpose is
to back-track to the nearest containing Library and start from there.  When traversal starts
from a Library, this extension indicates that the default strategy (recursion over the
containment tree) is sufficient.
